shift_message: "{@target}'s tail convulses and thrashes as {@colour} latex overtakes it, rapidly growing and flowing to encompass its entire shape. A rattling sound follows it out from the lower back, as segmented armor quickly follows the latex, interlocking and emerging. Bright lights flare into existence, glowing out from underneath and on top of the plates, casting a lighter hue of {@colour} around them. The end splits into an armored fin, and small dorsals adorn its length."
