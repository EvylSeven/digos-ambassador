Character Commands
==================
## Summary
These commands are prefixed with `character`. You can also use `char` or `ch` instead of `character`.

Commands for creating, editing, and interacting with user characters.

Parameters which take a character can be specified in two ways - by just the name, which will search your characters, and by mention and name, which will search the given user's characters. For example,

Your character: Amby  
Another user's character: @DIGOS Ambassador:Amby

You can also substitute any character name for "current", and your active character will be used instead.
