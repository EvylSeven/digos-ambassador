### Tips & Tricks 
Characters and roleplays can be specified in two ways - by just the name, which will search the ones you own, and 
by mention and name, which will search the ones owned by the named user.

Your roleplay or character: ipsum
Another user's roleplay or character: @DIGOS Ambassador:ipsum

You can also substitute any name for "current", and the active roleplay or character will be used instead.
