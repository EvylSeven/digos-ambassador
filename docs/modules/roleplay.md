Roleplay Commands
=================
## Summary
These commands are prefixed with `roleplay`. You can also use `rp` instead of `roleplay`.

Commands for interacting with and managing channel roleplays.

Parameters which take a roleplay can be specified in two ways - by just the name, which will search your roleplays, and by mention and name, which will search the given user's roleplays. For example,

Your roleplay: ipsum
Another user's roleplay: @DIGOS Ambassador:ipsum

You can also substitute any roleplay name for "current", and the active roleplay will be used instead.
