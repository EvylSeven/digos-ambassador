The main tentacle plays in the air, before spearing out into {@f|their} mouth, diving down into the throat. The interior of the mask lights up in a dazzling display of entrancing colours and patterns, filling every millimeter of {@target}'s vision. With a lurid slurp, the mask sets into place, hiding {@f|their} face behind the anonymous dark dome."
